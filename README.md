# Coursera-R-Programming-Assignment-2
The functions created in this assignment help users to minimise computing time in calculating the inverse of a matrix.
If the inverse has already been computed previously, it will be retrieved from the cache. Otherwise, the inverse of 
the matrix is calculated and set in the cache.
